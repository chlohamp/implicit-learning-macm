# Implicit Learning Meta-analysis

This repository conducts a meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis for regions that were posed by [Kovacs et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33630631/) to be involved in implicit learning and subsequent automatization of learned rules.


As we were not interested in visual stimuli, we are instead including regions of interest in clique 1 that were found in [Ramage et al. (2024)](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00355/124919/Elucidating-a-statistical-learning-brain-network/) to be associated with implicit artificial grammar learning, as well as the globus pallidus interna from [Manes et al. (2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25050431/) and medial dorsal nucleus from Iwabuchi et al. 2024.



Centroid coordinates for the 8 volumes included in the analysis are:
