# Implicit Learning Meta-analysis

This repository conducts a meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis for regions that were posed by [Kovacs et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33630631/) to be involved in implicit learning and subsequent automatization of learned rules.

We have modified them a little given that we are not interested in visual stimuli (his were visual) and are not sure that the premotor and motor cortex areas that he proposes are of interest given the difference in modality (and he did not specify the coordinates). For the latter, we are instead including regions of interest in clique 1 that were found in our [Ramage et al. (2024)](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00355/124919/Elucidating-a-statistical-learning-brain-network/) to be associated with implicit artificial grammar learning. Sophia has worked to find some references to support the choice of coordinates for other volumes that were not found in our previous work â€“ globus pallidus interna [Manes et al. (2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25050431/) and medial dorsal nucleus (from Iwabuchi et al. 2024).



Centroid coordinates for these volumes are:
